My solutions to the Matasano Crypto Challenges (http://cryptopals.com/), 
implemented in Python 3.

If you haven't done them yet, and plan to do them at some point (which you 
totally should!), DON'T LOOK!  That would be cheating and spoilers and all 
kinds of sadness.

Usage:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python test_cryptopals.py
